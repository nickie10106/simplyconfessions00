# Dress Up for July


## Dress for the Summer

Yes. I know Singapore only has two seasons: rainy and sunny. And, while we all love that we never have to worry about dying of hypothermia of clearing up orange leaves all over the ground, I think we can all agree that those two seasons don't make for the most interesting fashion choices.

So, to spice things up, we'll be ignoring our lack of seasons and dressing like summer has just arrived (even though its practically been here since January). And, what screams Summer more than mini dresses? Throw on some shades, relax and walk into Sentosa beach.

## Stamp Your Identity

Remember summer is the season of fun. And boring, plain, solid-coloured clothes may make you look cute but its definitely not a summer look. Try something bolder this summer. Floral prints, weird stripes, tie dye. All of them are valid this season.

## Nets? To Catch Some Attention

Everyone always treats summer like teh time of year to show some skin. While I do agree, I think an average tank top just isn't good enough. Try something different like a top with a net pattern. Go full Coachella vibes this season with cool net tops and denim shorts. Don't feel too shy to add a brown shoulder clutch and some shades to complete the look.

Acessories. Accesories. Accesories. I can't stress this enough. Having a cute top or dress just doesn't give you the perfect outfit. Clothes can only do so much to show your creativity when coming up with a stunning ensemble. So, to strengthen your look, try some cool shades for the summer or even some giant flamingo earings. Don't even say no to eye crystals! This summer, have the confidence to say yes to everything!
