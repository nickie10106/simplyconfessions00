# Romantic Tropes We Wish Could Happen In Real Life

## "I'm Sorry I Had to Give You Up For Something I Thought Was Bigger"

The whole 'I gave you up for my kingdom' trope may be a cliche but who can resist a well-written piece about sacrifice. Duty Vs The Heart. It is probably one of the most realistic struggles we face.

Angst. Fluff. These ships usually stem from some form of misunderstanding with person A believing they have been abandoned and person B nostalgically lamenting the loss of their happiness over duty. These ships are most commonly royalty or leaders of some sort with one being a realist and the other being an idealist.

## Cat and Mouse Game but With Love

What is love without a zest of spice and sugar. Some couples may love a sweet, wholesome and domestic life but these couples need some spice to liven things up.

Not to be confused with the 'Will They won't They' trope, these are the ships that viewers already know will end up together. They are usually best friends or co-conspirers that team up every two episodes to thwart someone. People will probably always refer to the other half of the couple as the other's significant other. And, they might even be officially dating throughout the series.

However, the thing that sets these couples above the rest is their penchant for mischief. These ships love messing with each other and it is not uncommon to find them flirting with outsiders just to score some jealousy points. They are also likely to take revenge on each other for domestic disputes.

But, ultimately, we love these couples because despite all of their bickering and teasing, they are probably ever so devoted to each other.

## Lovers To Best Friends Without A Hitch

Everyone - and, I mean everyone will always find themselves asking themselves this question at one point in their relationship. "What happens if we break up?" Do we split custody of our friends? Do we hide away from each other at opposite ends of town? Or, do we just pretend our relationship never existed and go back to being friends?

To us, peasant folk, the final one would be impossible. However, these are the couples that make us believe that it is possible. They are usually a part of a 'will they wont they' romance and it is probably somewhere in season 3 or book 3 when they break up and start to see other people. But, just when everyone expects major drama to come from their break up, these ships will choose to prioritise the sacredness of the friendship over any negativity they feel about their break up.

## Share An Ex

Ah yes. The old switcheroo. The ones that always ends up exceeding expectations. This couple is a fairly new trope since at least one or the whole love triangle needs to be a part of the LGBTQ+ community.

These ships are extremely cute and usually come as a surprise to fans who are tired and bored of the old love triangle female rivals trope. There may not be that many of these ships left but you can be sure that there are more to come.

## Friends to Enemies to Rivals to Friends to Lovers

Yes. Yes. I think we all love a good enemies to lovers trope. But, what about childhood friends to enemies to lovers? Adds more depth to it right?

Imagine the angst that comes with knowing that the your best friend. The one you've loved the most has descended into a life of evil. These stories usually take a darker twist and are meant for a more mature audience.
