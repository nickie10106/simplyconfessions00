# Steal the Style: Riverdale's Best Outfits

## Bad Girl. Leather chic

Serpent!Alice Cooper- or should I say Alice Smith? - definitely had one of Riverdales' strongest looks. From the black paperboy hat to the layered clothes and iron toed boots, she definitely looked like the Riverdale High's resident bad girl.

To get this look, layering is the key. Make sure you scavenge for every single accessory in sight and put them all on at the same time. Try going for something edgier and dark like spikes or chockers. Metal rings work too! Then, throw on an oversized leather jacket, wear a tank top inside. Also, remember to keep your make up light so it doesn't go overboard. And voila! You're a pre-Hal Cooper Alice Smith!

## Minimalist Upper East Sider

We all dream of the dinning at Butter and waltzing about the Atelier. Veronica Lodge is definitely a fish out of water in the murder-filled town of Riverdale but that doesn't make her outfits any less interesting. Tweed, cute and speakeasy material.

To get Veronica's season 3 look, all you have to do is wear a dress: preferably a solid colour (Ronnie doesn't do that patterned stuff), some strappy heels and a clutch or handbag (preferably Hermes like hers).

## "I Invented Red."

Yes. Yes. I know everyone has been waiting for this. Riverdale's most quotable character. For better or for worst, Cheryl is by far the most consistant character in the Riverdale cast. She's bitchy, spicy and unapologetically herself. And, of course half of her personality is the colour- Red.

To steal Riverdale's queen bee's style, you will need some red lip. Really red ones. I would reccomend stunna lip paint by Fenty Beauty for a long lasting soft matte look. Then, you just need an assortment of nets and plaid skirts. Remember red and black are your go to colours now.
