# Disney Remakes That Would Make Sense to Remake


## 5. Hercules

Underrated? Check. Unforgettable songs? Check. Space for Disney to take their own spin on it? Check! Check! Check! Disney's Hercules may not be as popular as a tale as old as time and it may not contain any Disney Princesses but it is definitely charming with its creative exposition and witty characters.

The animated movie told the story (a definitely much more PG version) of Hercules' birth as the son of Zeus and Hera (historically inaccurate but I definitely don't think Disney was trying to be) and how he was stolen from Olympus by Hades' minions and robbed of his godly powers before finding a home with an old couple on Earth. He grows up into a young man who definitely doesn't fit in with his peers and, rightfully, feels like he doesn't belong. He eventually finds out his true lineage, meets his best wingman (pegasus) and saves Olympus. Along the way, he meets Philoctetes or "Phil", a satyr who trains heroes, and Megara, probably one of the most interesting Disney animated love interests. The story also features one of the most comedic and sassy villains in the form of Hades. He may not be as scary as Jafar or Maleficent but he's definitely one of the more likeable and relatable Disney villains.

While the animated movie was an inspiring and refreshing take on the much... bleaker and grittier legend of Hercules(or Heracles), the movie never quite got the recognition it deserved. A live action remake that retains the film's original light-hearted and heroic tone would definitely bring this movie back into the spotlight and reintroduce a new generation of children to greek mythology. It would also definitely be interesting to see if Disney could develop more on Meg's tragic past!

## 4. The Princess and The Frog

Oh, Princess Tiana- amongst the forgotten in the Disney Princess line up, along with Pocahantas and Merida. Truly a tragedy considering that she is the only Disney Princess with a full-time job!

For most of us, Tiana is definitely not what you would think of when you think of the Disney Princess line-up. And, no- it's not because she is hardworking or breaking the whole 'damsel in distress' stereotype but it is simply because her journey is not as magical or epic as some of the other princesses. Set in the jazziest part of 1926 New Orleans, Tiana is a waitress saving up to open her own restaurant as a part of a dream she shared with her father, who had passed on. She is hardworking, realistic and definitely independent. Around this time, Prince Naveen, a prince who has been cut off from his parents, arrive in New Orleans in an attempt to marry rich and live happily ever after amongst the previleged (a goal which I can definitely relate to). However, before he manages to accomplish said endeavor, he gets himself cursed into a frog by the Voodoo Witch Doctor, Doctor Facilier. He, then, mistakes Tiana for Princess and offers her money to kiss him to break the curse. Romantic? Probably not. But, relatable? Extremely. Tiana, then, turns into a frog... with eyelashes and they set off on an adventure to become humans again. Together, they befriend an alligator, a fire fly and Mama Odie, a voodoo queen.

While interesting and definitely magical, Tiana's story was just not as big or jaw-dropping as Jasmine's or Ariel's. And, in my opinion, that is fine. At its core, The Princess and The Frog was never intended to be an epic fantastical adventure. It was just about a girl who wanted to open her own restaurant and I think that may be what sets it apart from the rest of the Disney Princess properties. This film shows little kids that it is ok to not want to be a princess or someone famous, it is not uninspired or 'boring' to want to be a chef in your own restaurant.

A live action Princess and the Frog remake would definitely shine a spotlight back on Tiana's story and introduce younger audiences to the voodoo magic of New Orleans in the early 1900s. The only major pitfall to adapting this film is how they would make the frogs look more appealing to the younger audiences. I mean, there is a reason why Tiana originally would not kiss frog Naveen. It wasn't because she was a bad person but frogs are just generally not the nicest animals to touch, much less, watch on screen for a whole 90 minutes! But, if anyone could make it work, it would be Disney!

## 3. The Little Mermaid
![The Little Mermaid](/img/blogs/11-06-19/2.jpg)<br><br>
Surprised this is on the list? Afraid a Little Mermaid remake will destroy your childhood memories? Well, I'm here to reassure you two things. First, it can't destroy your childhood if you remember that it is just a movie. And, secondly, I don't think Disney should remake Ariel's story.

The little mermaid is my favourite Disney Movie and, honestly, one that they should never change. Ariel’s bright eyed optimism and enthusiastic curiosity charmed a generation. However, told today, The Little Mermaid would be pretty by the numbers. Not to mention, there would be nothing new to add or spin to the tale (well, not that this has ever stopped Disney).

But, if they must. And, they have been saying that it is in the works, they should use the opportunity to homage to the little mermaid that Hans Christian Anderson wrote. Originally written to express his love and heartbreak about his failed romance with another man, Hans Christian Anderson’s original tale (tail) was full of unfortunate timing and tragedy. It starts out the same with the Little Mermaid falling in love with the prince after saving him from a shipwreck. She, then, falls in love, trades her fins for legs in exchange for her voice and must get the prince to fall back in love with her. In the Disney movie, Prince Eric falls back in love with her but they are constantly thwarted by Ursula the sea witch. In the original, however, the sea witch is a more neutral entity. The real antagonist is tragic fate. Unfortunately for the little mermaid, the original prince was already betrothed to another and he could not fall in love with her. In an attempt to save her, her sisters trade their beautiful hair for a dagger that she must kill the prince with. Her legs must touch the blood so they can turn into fins and she can return home. However, the little mermaid is unable to kill her beloved prince and, so, becomes the foam of the waves.

To say that Disney took some creative liberties would be an understatement. As mentioned before, the Little Mermaid was originally an allegory for Hans Christian Anderson's life and his relationship to another author. He faced rejection and was anguished. Although, not necessarily a great children's movie, a Little Mermaid remake that mixes the wide-eyed magic of the animation and the tragic twist of the original would definitely make for an interesting movie.

## 2. Hunchback of Notre Dame

Beautiful set pieces, amazing hand drawn cartoons, poetic lyrics that truly fleshed out character motivations. What more could you ask from a Disney animated property?

The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily one of Disney's most beautiful 2D films. The film is based on Victor Hugo's work and set in 1482 Paris, France during a time of gypsies and corruption. Slightly more adult, compared to the other Disney properties, but definitely worth it. The story tells of Quasimodo, a deformed boy who was 'saved' and 'raised' by the corrupt Frollo. Despite being isolated in Notre Dame Cathedral all his life, he grows into a kind and gentle young man who sees Frollo more as a master than a parent. Throughout the movie, we see Quasimodo being rejected by society and how his 'ugliness' affects his interactions with others. We learn of the cruelties that people face because they do not fit into society's mold. We learn about the corruption that lies under the surface and the fine line between crime and law. The Hunchback of Notre Dame captures the pragmatic view on poverty in Paris at the time while still maintaining a fantastical view on the situation. Although there is almost no magic involved (aside from the talking gargoyles which I thought were unneeded), the film feels like a fantasy more so than a realistic view on corruption in high powers.

Although the themes of the movie may not make for the best children's film, it is definitely worthy of adapting to live-action for a more mature audience. A live-action remake of the film would definitely introduce a new generation to these well-crafted characters.

Cause that’s all you have time for. By now, you have 6 minutes to get to school before you’re late. It’s just an added benefit that an apple a day keeps the doctor away.
