# Disney Remakes That Would Make Sense to Remake


## 5. Hercules

Underrated? Check. Unforgettable songs? Check. Space for Disney to take their own spin on it? Check! Check! Check! Disney's Hercules may not be as popular as a tale as old as time and it may not contain any Disney Princesses but it is definitely charming with its creative exposition and witty characters.

The animated movie told the story (a definitely much more PG version) of Hercules' birth as the son of Zeus and Hera (historically inaccurate but I definitely don't think Disney was trying to be) and how he was stolen from Olympus by Hades' minions and robbed of his godly powers before finding a home with an old couple on Earth.

On to the next step in our routine. Always remember to rehydrate. Although your body is not supposed to naturally feel dehydrated after a good night’s sleep, it is safe to assume you didn’t have a good night’s sleep. I mean, thanks to the ever-growing competition in the world, a good night’s sleep has been unheard of. So, make sure you drink up!

So, make sure you save some time for meditation. And, by meditation, I mean make sure you remember to bring everything you need for school. It’s always good to be prepared. But, who are we kidding? Life’s unpredictable.

## 1. Atlantis: The Lost Empire

Cause that’s all you have time for. By now, you have 6 minutes to get to school before you’re late. It’s just an added benefit that an apple a day keeps the doctor away.
