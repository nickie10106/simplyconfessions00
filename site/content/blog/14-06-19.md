# 5 LGBTQ+ Ongoing Series You’re Missing
![Phones are a Distraction](/img/blogs/04-06-19/1.jpg)<br><br>
In the past, series with healthy portrayals of LGBTQ+ characters were few and far between. However, today, almost every series has one or two LGBTQ+ characters. Sure, some of them are just token gay characters and some series tend to feed into the ever-so-popular 'bury your gays' trope, it is still amazing to see how many amazing LGBTQ+ characters and couples there are on TV.

But- as always-, there is never ever enough series to binge. So, if you are at the end of the Great Gay Migration or still emotionally impaired because of Killing Eve's season finale, here are 5 more obscure LGBTQ+ series that you should be watching.

## The Bold Type
![Phones are a Distraction](/img/blogs/04-06-19/1.jpg)<br><br>
  The Bold Type follows three friends, Jane (Katie Stevens), Kat(Aisha Dee) and Sutton (Meghann Fahy), as they navigate through their crazy lives working for global magazine- Scarlet. Sounds like a typical chick flick? Well, you may be right but it is also so much fun. The cast is constantly bursting with energy and you can't help but find them extremely likeable and charismatic.

  In Season 1, Kat meets out and proud muslim lesbian Adena Al-Amin, a photographer and artist invited to do a spread for Scarlet. Adena is definitely smitten by Kat and even asks her about her sexual orientation. Of course, at this point, Kat has not yet discovered her bi-side and states that she is straight. But, their interactions and undeniable chemistry would lead Kat to question her sexuality which leads to her iconic line- "I'm hetero, right?".

  Eventually, their relationship blossoms and they become a couple - an extremely cute, wholesome couple that challenges each other in healthy ways.  Although they do face many obstacles in throughout the series, they always try their best.

  To be honest, viewers might find The Bold Type to be cheesy, at times even cringe-worthy. Sometimes, their jokes miss the mark and sometimes characters may seem to be overly dramatic. But, at its core, it has a great message about empowering women. And, it is one of the few series featuring a muslim LGBTQ+ character.

## Gentleman Jack

Based on Anne Lister's journals, Gentleman Jack tells the tale of Anne Lister's return to West Yorkshire in 1832. May may not have heard of her but Anne Lister was an English landowner, diarist, mountaineer and traveller. And... she so happened to also be one of the out and proud lesbians from the 1800s. Labelled as the "The World's First Modern Lesbian", Lister was known for adopting male clothes and an independent attitude that women of the time were considered rude for having.

The series opens with Anne Lister (played by Soranne Jones) as she recounts her fall out with her ex-lover who left her to marry a man. Immediately, audiences are shown the clear prejudices people have against her through the servants' reactions to her kissing a girl and throwaway comments made by the residents of Halifax.

Fall in love with Soranne Jones' portrayal of the character and she charms her way through situations and attempts to abolish the monarchy. As a period piece, the series definitely emulates the problems of the time and goes one step further by making those problems feel relatable in a modern-day concept. This has been done through Anne Lister's romantic companion, Anne Walker, a young noblewoman who finds herself falling in love with Lister. Her struggles of coming to terms with her sexuality and her fear of the prejudices that exist in society for women like her are main obstacles are still relevant in today's context.

Overall, the series is one of those rare finds where it combines vibrant character, purposeful writing and artistic shots to tell an unforgettable story.

## POSE
![Yoga is great!](/img/blogs/04-06-19/3.jpg)<br><br>
Luscious. Artistic. Unapologetic. Pose is a beautiful yet pragmatic view on the African-American and Latinx ball culture in 1980s America. The series debuted in 2018 and burst onto the silver screen with fantastic set designs and fabulous outfits. It discusses the poignant but glimmering world that has been buried under discrimination and prejudice.

The series follows Blanca Evangelista (Mj Rodriguez), a trans woman of colour recently diagnosed with Aids. Follow her on her journey as she decides to use the rest of her time on earth to build a home or 'House' for others. Unlike many of Ryan Murphy's other series, the show doesn't try to hide or sugarcoat the discrimination that the trans community faces and it offers a realistic view on the different types of prejudices that they recieve for being themselves. The show goes as far as to show the hate that they recieve from the gay community by having Blanca be kicked out of a gay bar.

To say that Pose is sensational would be an understatement. It may not be for everybody but it is unlike any other series that has come before it.

## Andi Mack
![Meditate on how you will be late.](/img/blogs/04-06-19/4.jpg)<br><br>
Ah yes. Andi Mack. The show that made history as the first Disney Original Series to have a gay main character. Although the series does not necessarily have the best writing or acting, it definitely tries its best to open up conversations about more serious topics like being a single mother and gun control.

The series follows Andi and her friends, Cyrus and Buffy, as they go through high school life. While most of the series is focused on Andi, Cyrus is undeniably a fan favourite character. He immediately rose to prominance after he admitted at the end of season 1 that he was interested in Andi's love interest, Jonah. Unlike most coming out storylines, him coming out was slow and, in my opinion, more realistic. He was not forced out of the closet and nothing dramatic pushed him to decide that he was gay. Instead, he took time to understand that part of himself before coming out to Andi and, later, his parents. Cyrus even gets a somewhat love interest in the form of basketball team player, TJ, who he befriends and grows closer to over the course of the series.

Unlike most of the recent Dinsey Channel series like Austin & Ally or I Didn't Do It, the series definitely makes an effort to treat their audiences respectfully and not rely on lame jokes and laugh tracks. It almost reminds me of Season 1 of Girl Meets World descended into love triangle hell.
