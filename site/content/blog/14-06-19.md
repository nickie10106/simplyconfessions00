  Phones are a distraction. Touch them and you’ll never get anything on this list done! So, avoid looking at your phone first thing in the morning.

  Instead, be sure to look away as you slam your hand on your 10th or more alarm this morning so that you’re less distracted by the time and you can have a smooth transition into your morning routine.

Stretching is great for both your physical and mental health. Make sure to extend your body so that you’ll be covering more surface area on your bed.

So, make sure you save some time for meditation. And, by meditation, I mean make sure you remember to bring everything you need for school. It’s always good to be prepared. But, who are we kidding? Life’s unpredictable.

Cause that’s all you have time for. By now, you have 6 minutes to get to school before you’re late. It’s just an added benefit that an apple a day keeps the doctor away.
